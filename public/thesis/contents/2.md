Let us begin by taking a look at the first level in our model: The micro-layer.

As we discussed in Chapter 1, a service _performs_ in order to provide an _outcome_. In this chapter, we will study a selection of patterns from the world of engineering in order to distill a model that allows us to represent and think about _performances_ in an approachable fashion.

### 

Frequently, the core value definition of a service directly references its technical capabilities. For example, one of the main selling points of Google Docs, an online document editing platform, is its real-time document sharing, where multiple parties can work on the same document over the Internet[@googleDocs]. The core offering of Google Docs has fundamental implications for its system architecture: Communication and databases need to work in real-time and instantly synchronize across multiple clients[@postgresRealtime]. This illustrates why the technology behind a service is not just a necessity, but a core part of its design as a whole: User Experience specifications impact key system architecture decisions directly[@architecture].

## Engineering at scale

The concept of _technical debt_ defines how hard a codebase is to expand, adjust and scale[@technicalDebt] – in short, to maintain. A frequent contributor to _tech debt_ is code duplication — the same mechanism implemented repeatedly in different parts of the codebase[@codeDuplication]. This, together with a lack of documentation, elevates maintainability effort[@maintainability], which directly equates to technical debt.

Thus, one of the most popular principles in software engineering is DRY coding[@dryPopular] – Don't repeat yourself.

## Keeping it dry

The DRY principle is stated as: 

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system[@dry].

Any repeatedly occuring constant should be defined so that any dependant function simply references this single, global definition. 

It is easy to imagine pragmatic examples for this concept: When a service with an unfortunate code quality goes through a rebranding procedure, changing one of its primary brand colors represents an excruciating task of hunting down every occurence of the hardcoded color variable and changing it individually. If a _single source of truth_ were referenced instead however, this global could simply be updated and the change would instantaneously propagate through all of your interfaces automatically.

The concept of storing fundamental constants and repetitive patterns globally in the context of visual design for digital products is frequently applied as part of _Design Systems_. A Design System is famously defined as a library of reusable User Interface components, often co-existing as design specification and production-ready code components[@whatisDesign].

Design consultant B. Frost in 2013 coined the term "Atomic Design", which is a methodology for creating Design Systems divided into 5 levels: 

1. _Atoms_, tiny, abstract elements, "like color palettes, fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations", or basic HTML tags in the context of a website, such as a form label, an input or a button[@atomicWebDesign].
2. _Molecules_, "relatively simple combinations of atoms built for reuse", such as form fields jointed into a full form[@atomicWebDesign2].
3. _Organisms_, "groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface", such as the header of a website. This is where the analogy starts becoming specific to distinct projects[@atomicWebDesign3].
4. _Templates_, "groups of organisms stitched together to form pages", such as a generic, wireframe version of an article page for a news website[@atomicWebDesign4].
5. _Pages_, "specific instances of templates"[@atomicWebDesign5].

A specific implementation of a design system, "Lightning Design" by CRM behemoth Salesforce, takes _Atoms_ a step further and proposes a single source of truth for _atomic constants_, the very fundamental values that encode and express a brand visually.

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.[@designTokens]

In essence, this allows sharing constants like colors not just across one application, but a full suite of implementations. If the source of truth is adjusted, everything updates globally.

The Design System concept exhibits strong parallels to _Composability_, an often-cited principle in system design, generally referring to the design of systems using self-contained, modular pieces that can be individually adjusted, changed and upgraded[@composability].

## The Unix Philosophy

A well-known manifestation of the DRY paradigm as a composable system is the Unix Philosophy, originated by Computer Science pioneer Ken Thompson in the late 1970s[@unixOrigins]. Unix is a command-line based operating system developed at Bell Labratories that has since grown to be the basis of modern operating systems such as Ubuntu and Mac OS to this date[@macOs]. If you open the Terminal application on a MacBook today, you are interacting with an Unix system directly. User interfaces on these systems are simply executing commands like these behind the scenes. 

The Unix philosophy, summarized by computer scientist Peter H. Saulus in 1994, entails: 

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.[@unix]

The first paradigm represents a striking similarity to DRY. In Unix, it is possible to string multiple commands together and _pipe_ (represented by the pipe character | ) the first one's input into the next[@pipelines]. For example, the command `ls` (for _list_) simply prints the names of files and folders in the current working directory to the screen: 

```
$ ls
uglyCat.jpg
beautifulCat.jpg
dog.jpg
```

Another Unix application, `grep`, takes an input and outputs a filtered version based on a search term. By _piping_ the output of `ls` into `grep`, we can search the working directory's contents. Let us say we want to find the image of the dog in this folder. 

```
$ ls | grep "dog"
dog.jpg
```

As you can see, `grep` filtered the output of `ls` so that the resulting output is only the line including the term "dog". 

This demonstrates the paradigm perfectly: Both `ls` and `grep` do one thing, and they do it well. By stringing together multiple applications and making them interact with each other, we can quickly perform much more complicated patterns.

What does this have to do with services?, you might ask – let me tell you.


## Service Thinking in System Architecture

Let us think about what `grep` and `ls` really are. We, as the user, have a need – we need to find a file in our directory. `ls` and `grep` individually perform parts of what is needed in order to generate an outcome that satisfies our need – a filtered list of files in a directory. 

You might already be able to tell where this is going – we can treat `ls` and `grep` as _services_ as defined in Chapter 1. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume we write a simple script that encapsulates `ls`'s output piped into `grep` as a single command – `sd`, for _search directory_.

```
$ sd "dog"
dog.jpg
```

Now, we can define `sd` as our macroscopic service – with `ls` and `grep` acting as the atomic functionality inside, allowing `sD` to perform. 

<img src="/thesis/img/sdAsService.svg">

Since `sd` is very simple and we know exactly just how it achieves its outcome, we can go a step further and visualize the performance. Now, `sd` acts as the user to our two other services – `ls` and `grep`. By chaining our two bits of atomic functionality together, `sd` is capable of performing a vastly more complicated action. 

<img src="/thesis/img/sdMicroservices.svg">

Both `ls` and `cd` are entirely unaware of their role in this system. They simply perform the action they are designed to perform, nothing more, nothing else. They receive an input and provide an output – how said output is processed afterwards is irrelevant. 

In this example, `sd` is our macroscopic _service_, and `ls` and `cd` act as _microservices_.

### Microservices in real-world applications

More and more frequently, sophisticated systems are designed with the _Microservice_ paradigm[@msPopular], manifesting striking similarities to DRY and the Unix philosophy. In a Mircoservice pattern, business logic is split into _single responsibility_ atomic bits that each _do one thing, and do it well_. These services are _decoupled_, meaning they each have their own seperate place to live in and act, and do not know or care about others performing tasks around them[@microservices].

This kind of architecture comes with lots of benefits. Each little mechanism is ideally so small that its functionality can be described and documented in an extremely simple to understand way. More complex logic is simply a result of orchestrating individual small mechanisms in order to achieve the desired end result[@microservices2].
