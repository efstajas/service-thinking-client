So far, it seems like the concept of services is overwhelming. We are now aware that we depend on services – and services are ranging from streaming cat videos online to the streets[@ref1] you walk on every day, provided to you by your government which you pay in taxes. We[@ref2] also know that a service, beyond its face, is made up of intricate mechanisms that often themselves depend on other services – and we know that in this network, often services themselves act as users to other services.

While there are many slightly different definitions of the "Service" concept to be found in literature, a common definition includes two actors – the service itself and its user.

The User in this model has a set of needs, which causes seeking the respective service in the first palce.

Through economic defintions, we can add an exchange of value between these two parties. After all, without any value being provided in any way, potential users would have no incentive to become users (_convert_). In parallel, the service provider would have no incentive to support the service itself. 

The clear difference between traditional goods exchanges and services is that a service, at least in its core value defintion, _does not provide you goods_, but outcomes. When purchasing an item, a value transfer takes place – and after that, the client possesses the item that value was exchanged for. In a service context, the value is not manifested physically. For example, I can pay a service like Boldking on a monthly basis to deliver me razor blades every few weeks. While I do receive physical goods as part of this agreement, the _outcome_ of this service is _receiving fresh razor blades every few weeks_. By subscribing to this model, the user can rely on a third party to supply them with a frequently needed physical good, shifting responsibility from the user to the service, in exchange for monetary value. This kind of recurring, stable model allows the service provider to optimize their service's intricacies to a point where subscribing to a recurring service performance is often more lucrative for the user than sourcing the desired item on demand.

The service receives value from the user as well – may it be monetary, or something more abstract that represents value in another form. For example, search-giant Google offers _free services_ such as Google Mail or Google Maps. Those services do not require the user to pay in order to use them, but they generate valuable behavioral and personal data that Google is able to enrich by cross-referencing information from all their services, allowing them to lucratively monetize by using this information to provide another range of services – advertisment targeting. By combining these offerings across _Service Landscapes_, Google is able to provide vast value to seperate markets and its shareholders.

We can define these aspects in our model by adding the _outcome_, which satisfies the user's needs, and an _agreement_, which represents the value exchange between the service provider (in this representation, the service provider is represented by the service itself).

In order to provide an outcome, a service _performs_. The _performance_ is commonly defined as the sum of all mechanisms that act together as part of the service to create the desired outcome. When a user orders an item on Amazon, for example, the Amazon E-Commerce platform performs feats of logistics operations with the outcome being the desired item in your hands in often less than 12 hours.

In this model, we can define the _performance_ as the connection between the service, as the performing actor, and the _outcome_, which said performance leads to.

And with that – we have our base model and definition.

>> Services provide outcomes that satisfy user needs by performing the feats necessary to reach said outcome.


## The layer model

In order to explore our service model in greater detail, let us break down the service concept into multiple layers.

What we looked at so far can be defined as the _Macro layer_, where we look at a single service – outcome – user relationship. The _performance_ in this model a cluster of more services, each performing a smaller action that together allow our macroscopic service model to function and perform. Let us define this as the _Micro layer_, which represents all of these smaller sub-services as a whole. 

Multiple services often work alongside each other to make sense together. The actors in the above defined model do not necessarily need to be aware of this fact. Let us go back to Google's core business model – offering consumer services that generate valuable data to power an advertising platform capable of detailled profiling and campaign targeting. For this reason, let us add another layer on top of our macro layer: the _Service Landscape_.

In the following chapters, we will explore these layers in more detail, bottom to top.
