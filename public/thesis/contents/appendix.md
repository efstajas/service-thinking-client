## Interview with B. Oxendine

Held on April 1st, 2019. Personal interview. 

_Can you just start by telling me who you are?_

I’ve been working as a designer for the last 10 years. Currently working on the team at Grover. Before this I worked at a design agency called Fuzzco and before that I was a designer at Google.

_So, that’s Product Design, right?_

Yeah, I mean, I’ve worked between branding and product design in some form or another, but always focused on making the best experiences for people, regardless of the medium I’ve specifically been working in.

_Cool. So, as you know I’m writing my thesis right now. It’s about designing digital services. I’m trying to learn a bit more about how you approach structuring experiences – like, when you know you need a certain feature, how do you decide where to put it, stuff like that. What’s your thought process behind that?_

Structuring experiences… right, so if you’re starting with a system — a system of components, a structure of where things in the app live — then it should be relatively clear where to place things. It’s important to understand the basic functions of your app, like let’s say adding an item in a to-do app, and putting those basic functions into logical groups where they can be reused elsewhere in the experience. So you don’t end up designing two ways of adding a to-do in two different locations.

_And why would that be bad?_

Because it’s just confusing. If you reduce the total amount of concepts a user has to learn in order to use the app, then the app becomes easier to understand. The goal of designing good experiences is to make things feel natural, it shouldn’t feel like learning really, it should feel like a series of natural interactions. You should just kind of subconsciously “get it”. More screens, really, more anything in your app automatically makes it harder to understand, naturally. Your users won’t understand why there’s two ways to do the same thing, they’ll think that there has to be a difference somehow. 

_That makes sense. So, you said concepts. So, Going back to that to-do example, one of those concepts would be a to-do?_

Right. Like think of the things you can do with a to-do in this theoretical to-do app: you can create one, edit it, delete it, maybe put a reminder on it. That’s a good example actually. It wouldn’t be good to create to-dos and reminders as separate concepts. They should exist in the same system.

_Oh, I totally see what you mean. If you can tell the app to just remind you of a to-do, you don’t need reminders specifically as a separate concept altogether. You need only one way to create anything in your app, a to-do, not two separate ways to create and delete something, right?_

Right, and your user then doesn’t need to learn two ways to do what is essentially the same thing.

_What would you say is it about reminders and to-dos that makes it a good idea to merge them into a single concept? I mean, why do you create the to-do and then put a reminder on it, not the other way around?_

Well, a to-do has everything a reminder needs to be useful, like, some text, a deadline and a checkbox, and a reminder is like an extension of that. In this case maybe you get a notification about your to-do. You can create reminder functionality by notifying a user about a to-do and the other way around it doesn’t really work.

_Why not?_

I mean this is all hypothetical — actually, you’d want to test this kind of stuff with real users to see what they actually intuitively understand. But my intuition is just that the to-do should be the basis of this kind of app, because you can extend a to-do with a reminder. You could also create reminders and then remove the notification to get a simple to do. But see, now, the concept is getting harder to understand. Generally, the whole point I’m trying to make is — one way or the other, these two ideas are so similar, they should be the same concept, and you can create one from the other.

_I see. So basically you’re saying: A to-do does everything a reminder needs to do, the reminder is just that you get a notification about it._ 

Right, and duplicating those functionalities would just be confusing or inefficient from a user’s perspective.

_Thanks a lot for the insight!_
