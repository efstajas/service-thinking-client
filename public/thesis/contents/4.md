So far, we have defined our _service_ model, we have looked at how we can break down inner workings into atomic functionality, and we have defined dimensions and indicators for how efficiently our service solves real-world use-cases.

In the real world, services rarely come alone. Different services by a singular service provider are frequently offered alongside each other in order to deliver a range of offering solving problems in a particular market.

For example, the Berlin-based fintech organization N26 offers solutions for mobile banking. Their range of offering includes, amongst others, a bank account[@n26bankAccount], savings deposits[@n26savings], credit[@n26credit] and "Spaces"[@n26spaces] (the ability to create sub-accounts of sorts to save up towards specific goals). This pattern can be spotted all across the industry — other examples include search-giant Google offering almost 100 user- and business-facing services[@googleProducts], Amazon Web Services including around 150 distinct services[@awsServices], and Uber running a meal delivery service[@uberEats] alongside their main transportation offering. 

### Drawing the line

As per Chapter 2, micro-services that enable performances as part of a macroscopic service are _services_ as well, and all models defined so far apply to any _service_, regardless of context. It is entirely possible to shift focus of our analysis onto any _service_, including microservices. In Chapter 3, we have defined _the service baseline_ as the level at which our end-users interact with our product directly. 

Generally, as a result of the above, it is possible to shift the macro-layer of our analysis model to any _service_ instance, freely, regardless of context. This means that we can define a microservice that is just one of the many parts enabling the performance at the baseline level as the macro-layer, at which point all sibling-microservices in a given system form a _Service landscape_, and all even more fundamental bits of atomic functionality that may be at work within a given microservice in turn shape the micro-level. In this situation, just as is given on the micro-level regardless, both user and service on the macro-level are machines.

## Enabling a broad overview

N26 as a whole can be described as a service, with one baseline — and concepts like "making a savings deposit" can be defined as seperate use-cases for this service. However, as we are now inspecting a whole range of offering from a service provider, our approach will soon become overly complicated: We would be counting hundreds of individual needs, spread across hundreds of individual use-cases. For this reason, a more sensible approach would be to treat each individual offering (defined by a clearly seperated value proposition) as their own _service_, and introducing a final, global layer on top: The _Service Landscape_.

<img src="/thesis/img/serviceLandscape.svg">

Another argument is sufficient _outcome discrepancy_. Let us take another look at the example of Amazon Web Services (AWS). As already mentioned above, AWS, as of writing, constists of around 150 distinct services that each provide a specific value[@awsServices2]. Each individual offering furthermore provides fundamentally different outcomes; ranging from database storage[@awsRedshift] to speech synthesis[@awsPolly] to Blockchain solutions[@awsBlockchain]. Because their individual outcomes are so diverse — let us refer to this as a high _outcome discrepancy_ — they naturally become seperate service models. However, these seperate service entities still coexist in a shared space alongside each other.

Thus, in this chapter, we will define _service landscapes_ as the top-most layer in our model — the shared space serving as an umbrella for distinct services. Furthermore, we will research common industry patterns regarding the relationships between services that are part of a service landscape and expand our model accordingly.

## The common denominator

In order to understand and define service landscapes, let us look at real-world examples of multiple services coexisting.

AWS' many services all share the same branding — and they are aligned under a single, clear _value proposition_:

> Cloud Computing with Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. Explore how millions of customers are currently leveraging AWS cloud products and solutions to build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability and reliability.[@awsValueProp]

Similarly, banking-app N26's services are all branded homogeneously, with a shared _value proposition_:

> The first bank you’ll love. Take control of your finances. With just one app.

In both examples, users need to sign up for a global _account_ before being able to use individual services (e.g. applying for a loan on N26[@n26accountrequired], managing identity on AWS[@awsAccountRequired]). Individual services are sub-brands of the service provider (e.g. Amazon -> Amazon Redshift[@awsRedshift2], N26 -> N26 Spaces[@n26spaces2]). This pattern is commonly found across digital service providers that offer more than one core service; examples include G Suite, Google's business-to-business offering consisting of 19 distinct services[@gsuite], SaaS communication platform Intercom offering 3 core services[@intercom], and video-sharing platform YouTube providing 9 distinct services besides their main offering[@youtube]. In addition, every one of these examples has all individual services operate in roughly the same _domain_; for example, AWS services can be summed up as "Cloud Services", G Suite services are business productivity tools and Intercom offers tools for business-to-customer communication.

By the multitude of examples, we can add several attributes to our _service landscape_ concept:

<img src="/thesis/img/serviceLandscapeAttributes.svg">

- _Branding_: Services in a service landscape usually inherit its brand.
- _Authentication_: User accounts are usually created on the service landscape level and shared across child services.
- _Value proposition_: A service landscape usually cites a clear value proposition that holds true for its child services, whereas child services themselves are usually, in addition, individually marketed, with their own value propositions (e.g. Amazon EC2[@awsEC2], Intercom Inbox[@intercomInbox]).
- _Homogeneous Domain_: A service landscape usually includes individual services that operate in the same category, solving problems from a specific field (e.g. Cloud Computing) or a specific customer segment (e.g. Businesses, Private, Marketing Agencies etc.)

## Nested Landscapes

However, with the example of Google's range of consumer services, things are a lot less clear. While each service is branded consistently, their services appear to be positioned across a much broader spectrum of categories, listing only a _mission statement_:

> Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

With the Google Account, Google's services do share an authentication system. However, not all of their services inherit Google's brand (e.g. YouTube[@ytBrand]), a general value proposition beyond the before-mentioned mission statement is nowhere to be found, and with services ranging from education software[@googleEdu] to a mobile payment solution[@googlePay], a homogeneous domain is not defined either. Thus, Google's range of services does not constitute a _service landscape_ as we defined it.

When taking a closer look, Google does however maintain several service clusters with clear attributes of service landscapes – a selection of examples being Google Drive; a selection of online document editing services built around an online file storage system[@googleDrive], Google Cloud; a cloud-computing competitor to AWS[@googleCloud], Google Play; a suite of mobile apps enabling purchase and consumption of digital media such as E-Books[@playBooks], Movies[@playMovies] and Music[@playMusic], and G Suite; a range of business productivity tools[@gsuite2]. Each one of these service clusters meet the exact criteria for being considered a _service landscape_.

Interestingly, G Suite is part of Google Cloud, in itself however is a _service landscape_, while placed next the individual services constituting Google Cloud.

Due to the complexity in real-life business offerings, it is sensible to allow shaping _service landscapes_ more freely. We can add the ability to represent free-standing services, as well as nesting multiple _service landscapes_ into one-another.

<img src="/thesis/img/nestedLandscapes.svg">

In this situation, nested _service landscapes_ inherit attributes from their parent.

## Encoding bussiness capabilities in service architecture

While we are currently looking at a high-level representation of services — even above a service itself —, let me remind you that we defined services as entities that are built from microservices, that in themselves equally constitute a service model, and the service in itself resolves _needs_, which are defined as atomic bits directly mapped onto _resolutions_ in the service's outcome. In Chapter 2, we have taken a brief look at concepts from Software Engineering, such as DRY (_Don't Repeat Yourself_), and we have learned about the preffered practice of defining global constants in a single place. In Chapter 3, we have defined _needs_ and _resolutions_ as *shared between use-cases*, because in order to quantify them across use-cases, equivalent resolutions may only be counted once, and reducing the amount of concepts in a digital service positively impacts User Experience. 

Now that we are looking at multiple services in conjuction with _service landscapes_, we can go a step further and study patterns of sharing _atomic functionality_, _resolutions_ and _constants_ not just between use-cases, but between services.

### Sharing atomic functionality across services

One of our main properties of _service landscapes_ is the _shared authentication_ pattern: The user uses a single account to sign up at the landscape level and through this process gains access to individual services. This highlights the need of implementing the raw atomic functionality enabling authentication as a discrete service in order to prevent duplicated and potentially divergent implementations on the level of individual services. In Chapter 2, we have also briefly learned about _Design Systems_, which are a analog to DRY engineering for user interfaces and frequently reused constants such as colors. Since a _service landscape_ by definition shares a brand between itself and children, Design System constants will naturally rise above individual services in order not to violate DRY. Similarly, _service landscapes_ also impose a _homogeneous domain_ that is passed down to its children. As a result of this, the likeliness of specific _resolutions_ appearing in two seperate services within the same landscape is inherently high.

In order to follow the DRY paradigm, every time a specific _resolution_ is found to be present in at least two seperate services, the _atomic functionality_ enabling the _resolution_ should be decoupled into a seperate service entity that can be re-used across the _service landscape_.

Let us apply this concept to the authentication system, which, as we know, is shared across our _service landscape_. As authentication is likely to be required in order to access any of the services in a specific landscape, authentication automatically becomes a part of every single _set of needs_.

With _Branding_, _Authentication_, _Value Proposition_ and _Homogeneous Domain_, we have already represented top-down **inheritance** at a high level:

<img src="/thesis/img/serviceLandscapeAttributes.svg">

We can extend this concept to allow representation of sharing standardized bits of functionality between services. In order to do this, we need to define an indicator for distinguishing between user-facing and machine-to-machine services. In essence, we are required to tell if a service includes a _service baseline_ (defined as the point-of-contact between an end-user and the service). Ultimately, this allows telling apart user-facing from shared, internal microservices at the landscape level[@onlyAtLandscape].

<img src="/thesis/img/internalExternal.svg">

Here, Service A represents a service that end-users interact with, while Service B represents an internal service shared across a _service landscape_.

Let us now represent the sharing of an authentication service within a _service landscape_:

<img src="/thesis/img/sharingServices.svg">

We are representing the ability of each service nested inside a _service landscape_ to access the authentication service by displaying top-down inheritance. Please note that just as _service landscapes_ inherit their parent's attributes and pass them down to their respective children, the same is true for services: Here, Service A, B and C all can use the authentication service, while Service D, not being a child of the _service landscape_, can not.

### Microservice architecture as a mirror of business capabilities

An established and common pattern in the design of microservice architecture is directly translating business capabilities such as displaying and shipping a product directly into system architecture[@mappingServices]. This entails manifesting core mechanisms as entirely seperated systems that can be developed, maintained and deployed seperately from one-another, allowing for a _single-responsibility_ model as described in the Unix Philosophy (Chapter 2).

As part of our service model, we can define a simple process for distilling these core mechanisms using our existing concept of _resolutions_ (atomic bits of functionality directly mapped against a user's needs).[@notReallyServices]

1. Identify similar _needs_ across services in a service landscape.
2. Design a single _resolution_ that is capable of resolving all these similar _needs_.
3. Inject an internal service capable of performing the designed _resolution_ so that all services which share the initial _need_ are able to access it.

### Inheriting distributed constants
