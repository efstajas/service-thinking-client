The introduction to this thesis was an attempt to highlight how extremely omnipotent _services_ are in our daily lives — not _just_ digital services like Spotify and Google, but basic needs such as roofs over our heads. However, for the scope of this paper, I chose to focus on digital services alone — the simple reason being the desired length of 60,000 characters.

What struck me over and over while writing this paper: Many of these concepts I thought about and wrote down after deep-diving into these four levels of my basic "service" model apply to a surprising amount of situations outside the digital realm.

Take this illustration from Chapter 1, for instance:

> This thesis aims to illustrate digital services in a unified model that can be applied to a service concept from the microscopic layers of so-called "atomic functionality" — small, dedicated mechanisms with a single responsibility — to the macroscopic layer that the defines the service and its performance itself, to "Service Landscapes"; a cluster of individual service models that can be used to express relationships between individual services. We will study each layer in detail and talk to experts in their respective fields in order to distill our model, attempting to deliver a coherent concept that can be used to design, define, analyze and optimize digital services.
