To recite the research problem of this thesis: 

> This thesis aims to distill a framework for modeling digital service concepts by breaking down fundamental mechanisms into "atomic functionality", to then build up a multi-layered model that can be applied to individual services as well as multi-service relationship patterns. We will study paradigms from the world of Software Engineering and User Experience Design to base our model upon, attempting to deliver a coherent concept that can be used to design, define, analyze and optimize digital services. 

In order to validate our model, let us attempt to apply it to a real-world example.

## You are using a service right now

If you are reading this thesis on service-thinking.jason-e.dev, you are interacting with a service entity that can be described by the very model defined in the content that it serves.

This thesis was written in Markdown — a document format used to format documents with simple structures such as headlines, lists and quotes. Markdown can be extended by custom parsing — meaning, new document syntax may be added, and the interpretation of existing syntax may be adjusted.

Behind the scenes, the web application you are using is written in Vue.js, a framework that offers abstractions on top of JavaScript, the programming language of the web. In JavaScript, chunks of functionality and code may be expressed as _modules_; small, reusable bits of code that can be _imported_ elsewhere.

### Defining use-cases

At the beginning of this project, I made the decision to write my thesis in a way that allows me to be _medium agnostic_, meaning: The content itself is expressed in a format that may be displayed in a multitude of different ways. The Markdown format was the obvious choice, as its syntax translates directly onto common concepts of HTML as well as LaTeX, a formatting framework designed for scientific work.

With this flexibility, I am able to render the thesis as a scientific work, complete with scientific notation, and also display it in a custom-made web _service_ I call `md_thesis_head` (_markdown thesis head_, head being a metaphor for frontend) — which, if you are reading this thesis on my website, you are using right now.

We can describe your (you, as the user) relationship with this service using our basic model from Chapter 1:

To apply the breaking-down of needs and resolutions as detailed in Chapter 3, we need to make some assumptions — mainly, what actually are the user's needs? 

Let us define two main use-cases to cover for the scope of this analysis:

1. **Reading a thesis casually**. The reader intends to consume content casually.
2. **Reading a thesis scientifically**. The reader intends to consume the content as part of further research or intends to validate its conclusions.

As a scientific work in itself, the content that  `md_thesis_head` displays fulfills a number of requirements, mainly citations expressed in scientific notation, a clear structure as chapters and sub-chapters, an introduction, a list of sources with metadata and an appendix.

When designing  `md_thesis_head`, I set out to solve those main use-cases, meaning I needed it to support, understand and display these requirements for a scientific paper.

### Distilling needs

We can break down use-case 1 into individual _needs_.

- I need to consume the content I requested.
- I need to navigate through the content.
- I need the format to be readable and accessible.

This case focuses on the raw consumption of content. Use-case 2 however encompasses a wider range of needs.

- I need to consume the content I requested.
- I need to navigate through the content.
- I need the format to be readable and accessible.
- I need to be able to view scientific sources while consuming the content.
- I need to be able to view a directory of sources to validate them.
- I need to be able to verify authorship.
- I need to be able to verify originality.

*Please note that use-cases in this chapter are simply defined from a list of formal requirements set by my university, as the research and definition of them is not part of this thesis' intended scope. In reality, defining these use-cases requires substantial research.*

According to Chapter 3, our _set of needs_ on the use-case level is equivalent to all needs expressed by the user in a specific situation. Thus, use-case 1 has a smaller absolute breadth than use-case 2. Use-case 2 exhibits the same three first needs as use-case 1, which can thus be considered an _extension_ of use-case 1.

I will now explain briefly how I used Service Thinking to model, design and guide implementation of  `md_thesis_head`, in order to then analyze its performance using the dimensions defined in Chapter 3.

## Defining service structure

`md_thesis_head` does not display "Service Thinking", it displays a _thesis_. By adjusting input, it can render any thesis in the same fashion as this one. This is result of breaking down mechanisms into _atomic functionality_: By thinking of concepts as reusable components, finding common attributes, and mapping them to resolutions directly, an instance of _thesis_ in `md_thesis_head` does not apply to this very thesis in itself, but a _thesis_ as a generic concept.

As our use-case 2 has the highest _breadth_ and includes all _needs_ from use-case 1, let us focus on the first case for defining our required _resolutions_. As expressed in Chapter 3, we can map resolutions directly onto resolved _needs_: 

- I need to consume the content I requested -> Render content.
- I need to navigate through the content -> Represent text structure clearly by rendering a clickable table of contents.
- I need the format to be readable and accessible -> Extend HTML with custom, accessible styles.
- I need to be able to view scientific sources while consuming the content -> Render citations adjacent to content.
- I need to be able to view a directory of sources to validate them -> Render a source directory.
- I need to be able to verify authorship -> Display a "Cover" page including metadata about the thesis.
- I need to be able to verify originality -> Display an "Appendix" page that includes a declaration of originality.

As described in Chapter 4, our model allows defining the macro-level flexibly. For the purpose of planning the internal structure of `md_thesis_head`, we can shift the macro-level one level below the _service baseline_ (which in this context simply refers to `md_thesis_head` as a _service_, as shown in the earlier diagram on this page). Like this, we can start thinking about code and UI structure.

If we take a closer look at the above list of intended resolutions, we see that every single resolution depends on the concept of a _thesis_ itself. In order to display a thesis or parts of it (such as appendix and cover) or break it down into a structured representation, our service needs access to a _thesis_. When analyzing this further, we can define a list of specific properties that each _resolution_ above _needs_ (this illustrates the power of shifting the macro-level even further: even our resolutions can be expressed as services that act as users to the services we will now define, with their own respective sets of needs):

- Metadata like name, subtitle and author -> For displaying a cover page.
- A structured representation of the thesis -> For representing structure and enabling navigation.
- Actual source content -> For rendering the content itself.

Based on this analysis, I defined the concept of a `thesis` and a module around it, providing this data to the respective mechanisms that _need_ it: `ThesisProvider`, with separate small functions in it each resolving one of the three _needs_ above.

Another global need is a structured representation of sources and references ("Render citations adjacent to content"). Similarly to the `thesis` concept, I thus defined `refs` as a structured list of citations (using the open standard BibTeX). Analog to `ThesisProvider`, I defined `RefProvider` as a set of mechanisms that allows retrieving citations flexibly.

Next, I matched the required resolutions in order to create a list of modules that can together solve our two use-cases:

- A component that renders markdown text into a style-able visual representation (`MdText`, `Chapter`) -> Render content, Extend HTML with custom, accessible styles
- A component that renders a side-navigation with of thesis contents (`Nav`) -> Represent text structure clearly
- A component that displays a citation adjacent to content (`Citation`) -> Render citations adjacent to content
- A component that renders a Source Directory page (`Sources`) -> Render a source directory
- A component that renders a Cover page (`Cover`) -> Display a Cover page
- A component that renders an appendix page (`Appendix`) -> Display an "Appendix" page that includes a declaration of originality

As a User Experience decision, I decided to split Chapters between separate web-pages, simply in order to preserve overview and reduce loading times. This is why I defined `MdText` as a component that simply parses and renders a markdown source, and `Chapter`, serving as a top-level view that controls which chapter should be displayed. `Chapter`, `Cover` and `Appendix` each require rendering markdown text, as our source is written in markdown. These components thus depend on `MdText` in order to actually render their content. Furthermore, they also depend on `Citation` in order to display possible references adjacent to content.

We can represent these relationships as _services_ within two nested _service landscapes_, with our two non-baseline services `ThesisProvider` and `RefProvider` injected as top-down inherited services (see Chapter 4: Sharing atomic functionality across services) and `Citation` and `MdText` injected as dependencies in the nested landscape. 

<img src="/thesis/img/exampleLandscape.svg">

*Please note that this representation does not take framework-level mechanisms and dependencies into account.*

To sum up the context of this diagram: We are now looking at the result of inspecting the microservice architecture of the singular service `md_thesis_head` by shifting the macro-level to the individual components enabling its _performance_. We have gotten to this point simply by breaking down use-cases into _needs_, defining for the resolutions of those _needs_, and then defining common denominators — mechanisms needed in multiple individual services, shared as top-down inheritance in a _service landscape_.

## Analyzing service performance

After the service is actually implemented, we can make use of dimensions defined in Chapter 3 to quantify and understand its performance.

*For the sake of simplicity, I will refrain from analyzing the _quality_ of individual resolutions and instead treat resolutions as absolute regarding solving their respective need.* 

Let me remind me of our two main use-case definitions, expressed as _sets of needs_:

1:
- I need to consume the content I requested.
- I need to navigate through the content.
- I need the format to be readable and accessible.

2:
- I need to consume the content I requested.
- I need to navigate through the content.
- I need the format to be readable and accessible.
- I need to be able to view scientific sources while consuming the content.
- I need to be able to view a directory of sources to validate them.
- I need to be able to verify authorship.
- I need to be able to verify originality.

Let us apply our _service resolution_ concept by mapping delivered _resolutions_ onto these use-cases, first for use-case 1, then use-case 2. For the sake of overview, let us group the above-defined _service landscape_ consisting of `Chapter`, `Cover` and `Appendix` as _Views_ as their structure is sufficiently similar. Now, we can look at which _needs_ which _resolution_ solves: 

1: 
- I need to consume the content I requested -> `Views`
- I need to navigate through the content -> `Nav`
- I need the format to be readable and accessible -> `Views`

2: 
- I need to consume the content I requested -> `Views`
- I need to navigate through the content -> `Nav`
- I need the format to be readable and accessible -> `Views`
- I need to be able to view scientific sources while consuming the content -> `Citation`
- I need to be able to view a directory of sources to validate them -> `Sources`
- I need to be able to verify authorship -> `Cover`
- I need to be able to verify originality -> `Appendix`

We can thus discern that our _resolutions_ map onto our initially defined use-cases without gaps, resulting in a _service resolution_ of 100%. 

In reality, especially with more complex services, not every use-case can be anticipated entirely. This analysis requires frequent research into actual user needs in order to carry meaningful value.

Similarly, we are now able to calculate the remaining dimensions from Chapter 3:

- __Case Resolution__: Case 1: 100%, Case 2: 100% (needs fully matched)
- __Breadth__: Case 1: 3, Case 2: 7
- __Service Breadth__: 7 (as 3 _needs_ in both use-cases are sufficiently similar)
- __Loss__: Case 1: 0, Case 2: 0 (no unmapped needs)
- __Service Loss__: 0.
- __Overhead__: Case 1: 4, Case 2: 0
- __Service Overhead__: 0

This concludes our analysis of how the Service Thinking approach helped me structure, implement and assess performance of `md_thesis_head`.

## Reflections on research goals

In the introduction, I described services as an almost omipotent concept appearing in our daily lives, but then limited the scope of this thesis to _digital_ services specifically.

What repeatedly struck me during my research process: Many of these concepts detailled throughout the thesis could potentially map onto more traditional _offline_ services remarkably well. I urge you, as the reader, to go back and think about how these models could be applied to a wider range of service types.

In retrospect, I am confident that this model does in fact describe services accurately, and through its various dimensions provides valueable metrics towards identifying problems and tracking optimization process. While I did not include measures of _quality_, combining defined metrics with performance indicators from the field of UX Research may yield even greater insight that can be applied selectively to individual services — on any of the three levels. Similarly, I see immense potential in applying economic indicators as well: By combining measures such as _breadth_ and _resolution_ with cost analysis, the analysis could result in interesting optimization strategies. 

Wether I succeeded in making you, the reader, "adopt a modular way of thinking" is up to you to decide — but I do sincerely hope that I did.
