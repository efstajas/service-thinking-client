To recite the research problem of this thesis: 

> This thesis aims to distill a framework for modelling digital service concepts by breaking down fundamental mechanisms into "atomic functionality", to then build up a multi-layered model that can be applied to individual services as well as multi-service relationship patterns. We will study paradigms from the world of Software Engineering and User Experience Design to base our model upon, attempting to deliver a coherent concept that can be used to design, define, analyze and optimize digital services. 



Take this illustration from Chapter 1, for instance:

> This thesis aims to illustrate digital services in a unified model that can be applied to a service concept from the microscopic layers of so-called "atomic functionality" — small, dedicated mechanisms with a single responsibility — to the macroscopic layer that the defines the service and its performance itself, to "Service Landscapes"; a cluster of individual service models that can be used to express relationships between individual services. We will study each layer in detail and talk to experts in their respective fields in order to distill our model, attempting to deliver a coherent concept that can be used to design, define, analyze and optimize digital services.
